## Welcome to Openleaf

*If you want to work with people as passionate about your success as you are, you'll love to work with us!*

Openleaf is a unique business and management consultancy based in Auckland. We work with people and business of all sizes, of varying levels of maturity, and across a wide range of industries to implement positive change.

We thrive on working with people to help solve business problems and assist in decision making. We help businesses decide how to grow, how to innovate, and how to find positive solutions to challenges they currently face – whether these relate to finances, staff and management, operations, technology, or other areas.

We use creative methods, and real evidence as part of our value-based consulting approach. This helps us find ideas and solutions no matter how big or small the problem is. We have almost 25 years of combined international experience, and we’re passionate about applying this to help New Zealand businesses grow and thrive.

*Feel free to [get in touch](/contact) if you'd like to know more about how we can help you...*
