## About Us

Openleaf is a New Zealand owned and operated family business founded in 2013 by Mary-Anne and Daniel Merriott.

We have almost 25 years of combined professional experience, including senior management roles and advisory roles, as well as consulting and project delivery. We've worked at and with some well known brands (e.g. BBC Worldwide, HSBC, Rabobank, Sainsbury's) as well as a number of smaller businesses.

From our breadth of experience, we bring first-hand knowledge of international best practices, and real-life, practical experience of finding and implementing results that matter. Weâ€™re passionate about applying this to help New Zealand businesses grow and thrive.

## Our Approach

We want to work in a way that is meaningful to us: doing business in a relaxed and friendly way, with integrity, and creating *real value* for our clients.

This means we give straight answers and always keep it as simple as possible. Honesty and integrity are essential for us - we believe this is part of how we form lasting relationships.
